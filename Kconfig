    int
    prompt "Milliseconds between push button polling periods"
    default 10
    help
        A higher number means less frequent polling, but uses less CPU cycles.
        Too high of a polling period and you might miss valid button presses.

config EASY_INPUT_PUSH_BUTTON_DEBOUNCE_PERIOD
    int
    prompt "Number of polling cycles with switch in active state to be considered actuated"
    default 4
    help
        A switch's counter is incremented everytime it is active during a polling
        cycle. A switch's counter is decremented everytime it is not active during
        a polling cycle. When a button's counter reaches this threshold, it is
        considered a successful button push.
